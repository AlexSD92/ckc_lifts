            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Fitness is crazy these days. And that can be really, really overwhelming. No matter where you look
                there are people, websites, news, and books telling you how to exercise, where to exercise, and when to exercise. 
                Fitness gurus around the globe will go on to specify diets to 'hack' your body, so you can get the most out of your
                gym sessions. After all, gym sessions are a waste if your diet isn't right. With all of that in mind, where do you even begin?
                We're here to help with that. 
                <br><br>
                Here at CKC lifts, we believe in the fundamentals. We believe that the best exercise is often a return to the basics, to the fundamentals.
                No complicated, ambiguously named exercises, no fads or trends, and certainly nothing that you aren't capable of doing so long as your 
                heart is in it. We're here to help, and we will do that by focusing on the fundamentals of human movement. By doing things that 
                your body was always meant to do, we will help you reach your fitness goals.</p>

            <h2>Who We Are For</h2>
            <p>We are for everyone. Sounds a little cliche, we know. But that's that honest truth. No individual is left behind. 
                It doesn't matter how old you are. It doesn't matter how fit you are. It doesn't matter how skilled you are. We are 
                very inclusive and embrace people from all backgrounds and levels. Everyone has something to bring to the table. 
                <br><br>
                With that in mind, please don't be intimidated if you are a beginner, we're great teachers and you will be a part of 
                a community that is willing to help you reach your goals, whatever they may be. And if you've been with us for a while 
                you know that this is true, and that it's a great place to make friends, learn and smash your goals. 
                <br><br>
                The only requirement is that you have a goal in some way shape or form. And that can be anything. Some people join us 
                to lose weight. Others to gain weight. Some join us because they want to become better athletes. Others want to be strong.
                Whatever your goal is, we will work with you to achieve it.

            <h2>What You Can Find Here</h2>
            <p>There are a few things you will be able to find on this site. The main thing, as the name implies, is information on 
                <a class="inline" href="whyckc.html">CKC Lifts</a> (closed kinetic chain), such as the squat. If you head on 
                over to the 'Why CKC' link in the manu, you will find a page dedicated to the history and form of the king of all CKC lifts, 
                the squat.
