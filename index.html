            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Fitness is crazy these days. And that can be really, really overwhelming. No matter where you look
                there are people, websites, news, and books telling you the best way to excercise. Where do you even begin?
                Well, we're here to help with that. Here at Squatology, we believe in simplicity. We believe that the best 
                exercise is often a return to the basics, to the fundamentals. No complicated, ambiguously named exercises, no fads 
                or trends, and certainly nothing you aren't capable of doing. We're here to help. Let's return to the fundamentals.</p>

            <h2>What You Can Find Here</h2>
            <p>There are a few things you will be able to find on this site. The main thing, as the name implies, is information on how
                to squat. If you navigate over to 'Squats' near the top left of this page, you will find a page dedicated to squat form
                and technique depending on your physiology. If you like what you see and are interested in joining our community, take
                a look at 'Our Gym' to view our facilities and some images of our members. Last but not least, to sign up or ask us anonymous
                questions, head on over to the 'Sign Up' page where you can find a form to ask us questions and a separate form to sign up.
                On this main page, you will also find upcoming events (we believe in exercising outside as much as we exercise inside). We
                invite you to turn up to these evens to see what we're about, ask questions and even participate, no membership required.</p>
