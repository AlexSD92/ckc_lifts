        <h2 id="fundamental">The Fundamental Squat</h2>

        <p id="fundamentalp"> We all used to be <em>amazing</em> at squats. There was a day and age where we had all
            the flexability, strength and form to perform proper squats. I don't ever rememeber being able to
            do that, you say? And to that, I ask, have you ever seen a toddler squat? - If you've never taken
            the opportunity to watch them as they squat down to pick up a toy or some random object off the floor, 
            I highly recommed that you do. We have a lot of things to remember from our toddler selves that we
            unfortunately end up forgetting as we grow up from childhood through to adolescence and adulthood. As
            we grow up, our opportunities to to move naturally are gradually removed from our daily lives. Eventually,
            we just forget how to move properly add efficiently. Think about it, as an adult, how much time do you
            have to play? How much time do you spend standing up a day? <br> <br> The squat is <strong>fundamental</strong> 
            and profound part of our learning and development as toddlers. It is a profound part of our 
            kinaesthetic education that extends into many other types of motions, such as walking, running, jumping, 
            lifting, etc. If you're new to fitness or a complete beginner to squats, I'm willing to bet you can't
            squat, or if you can, you're unbalanced and not very comfortable or balanced getting in to the position.
            At squatology, we beleive in returning to the fundamental movements that the human body was designed 
            to do.

        <h2 id="ckc">CKC</h2>

        <p id="ckcp">CKC stands for closed kinetic chain. It's honestly a lot fancier sounding than it is.
            The best way to describe it is like this: Any excercise where the end of your limbs can move freely
            is not an CKC exercise. For example, a squat is a closed kinetic chain exercise (and a compound
            movement at that, meaning it involves multiple joints). With a squat, your feet are planted
            firmly on the ground and unable to move. The extension mainly occurs through your ankles, knees,
            hips, and back, where your calves, quads, gluts, and spinal muscles pull on your joints to bring 
            you from a squatting position to a standing and neutral position. By contrast, an exercise such as 
            leg extensions are OKC, or open kinetic chain, exercises. The end of your limb moves freely in this 
            exercise and it is a simple and isolated movement (not involving multiple joints). <br> <br>
            Open kinetic chain exercises can mess you up if you're not careful. The reason for this is because
            they are isolated movements. Bodybuilders use these a lot to focus heavily on individual muscles, 
            because their goal is to get as big as possible. The problem with this is that you can create 
            imbalances between your muscles. This is how you end up with knee or hip pain. Because you have
            one muscle that because much stronger than other muscles in the group, your joints can end up 
            strained and slightly out of position, causing other muscles to compensate in an attempt to correct
            the issue you're having. Before you know it, you've got ridiculously tight hamstrings and your 
            lower back has never felt worse. This is because you are teaching your muscles to move as individual
            components when they were never designed to behave or move that way. Muscles work in groups, which 
            is why exercises like the squat are so powerful and have demonstrated to reduce joint pain when
            used correctly as a rehabilitative exercise.

        <h2 id="health">Health Benefits</h2>

        <p id="healthp"> You will see a lot of benefits, but let's outline some of the key ones.
        <br> <br>
        - Your cardiovasucal health with improve tremendously. Squats are a physically
        demanding exercise, and your body will learn how to cope with the demand.
        <br> <br>
        - Your lung capacity will improve. Squats demand oxygen, and a lot of it, especially
        when it comes down to heavy weights or high rep ranges. 
        <br> <br>
        - You will become stronger, and not just in your legs. Of course, you're going to 
        notice your legs will become stronger first, but because squats are a compound 
        and demanding exercise, you will use other muscles without knowning it including 
        your abs and back.
        <br> <br>
        - You will feel happier. Squats have a weird psychological effect because you are 
        reawakening a long lost neuropathway. You might even have childhood memories pop in
        to your head.
